# Data Mining and Optimisation for Software Engineering

## Software Engineering? {.build}

-   IEEE Standard Glossary of SE Terminology Std 610.12-1990, 1991
    1.  SE is the application of a systematic, disciplined, **quantifiable** approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.
    2.  The study of approaches as in (1)
-   Software engineers should ...
    -   ... Measure, Test SW, Estimate, Manage projects, i.e., effort estimation, planning

> In God we trust, all others must bring data (W. Edwards Deming)

> You can't control, what you can't measure (Tom DeMarco)

## Software Analytics

`Software analytics` is to enable software practitioners to perform data exploration and analysis in order to obtain insightful and actionable information for data driven tasks around software and services (Zhang et al, Malets'11)

## Software Analytics

As with `KDD` (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) the idea is also to find useful information that was previously unknown!

## Sources of Information

-   `Version Control Systems` or Soft Conf Mang, e.g., Git, SVN
    -   Artifacts: Source code, Models, Tests, Requirements, Documentation,...
    -   Meta-information about the artifacts: What, Who, Where, When, Why
    -   Main public repositories: GitHUB, Bitbucket
-   `Issue/Bug tracking systems`: Bugzilla, Jira, SourceForge
-   `IDE`s: Software Testing, AI assisted development
-   `Mailing lists` (even question & answer websites)
-   `Google Play` and `AppStore` e.g., reviews, starts (quality), updates ...
-   `Simulation` can also be used to generate tons of data! e.g. System Dynamics to deal with `What if?` type of questions

## SDLC Example of Possible ML related Questions/Optimisations

-   `Requirements`: What requirements will provide most user satisfaction while maximising profit, usability, etc? Effort and cost estimation with AI

-   `Analysis and design`: Can we re-organise code/modules/packages so is better distributed for performance/division of labour/allocation of resources, maintenance, etc.

    -   Coupling and cohesion of modules
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   `Coding`: All types of metrics can be collected from code to predict artifact defects, allocate testing effort, code clone detection, etc.

    - `Genetic Improvement` how to plug modules or third party components automatically (e.g., video codecs)?
    
    - `AI Assisted Development` helping with APIs, suggesting code, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   `Testing`: Most testing techniques can be seen as an optimisation problem, test cases should cover (measured as LoC, branches, etc) as much as possible with the minimum no. of test cases

    -   Regression testing optimisation and selection of test cases
    -   There is also reliability estimation, when to stop testing

-   `Maintenance`: Regression testing (or how not to break something when we fix another thing)

-   and finally `Phase out`: When is time to stop/quit maintaining a project?

## Project Management

-   Also ML can be applied in `Project Management` Decisions, decisions, decisions!
    -   Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements (PMI).
    -   Multiple projects/personnel/resources
    -   Iron triangle: Time, cost and scope

Pick any two! (Source:Wikipedia)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Decision making tasks that need to be optimised!
-   And possibly multi-objective!
    -   Estimation of Cost/Effort/Schedules
    -   Assignment of personnel to tasks consdiring multiple projects run in parallel
-   And we can help `project managers` with:
    -   Rules, Fuzzy rules, Association Rules
    -   Regression techniques
    -   Visualisation of project status, early warning of problems, etc.

## From the DM point of view

|                     |                            |
|:-------------------|:---------------------------:|
| Classification      | Defect prediction      |
| Regression          | Effort and cost estimation   |
| Recommender Systems | How to use an API, function calls that tend to be together   |
| Time series         | Evolution of Projects (Clustering/classification of time series)  |
| Text/Web mining     | Reviews, bugs reports, requirements from textual descriptions, code comments, documentation, Function and variable names |

## From the DM point of view (cont.)

|                     |                            |
|--------------------|:---------------------------:|
| Social Net Analysis |   Mailing lists, GitHub    |
| Process Mining      | Logs collected automatically in Web servers, how actual processes are run, are they followed correctly? can processes be optimised? |
| Sequence patterns   |  Run-time traces           |
| Graph Mining        |  Dynamic call graphs       |

## SE Repositories

Free/Libre Open Source (FLOSS) has provided tons of data to be analysed. Nowdays, the most popular (`Big Data`!)

::: centered

:::

For project management, there is the ISBSG (International SW Benchmarking Standards Group) database but it is not open: <http://isbsg.org/>

-   `Small data`! R2021 - approx 11,600 projects and 60 atts

# What about papers? {.build}

There is a large no. of related conferences:
