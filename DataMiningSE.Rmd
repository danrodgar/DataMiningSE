# Data Mining and Optimisation for Software Engineering


## What is Software Engineering? {.build}

- IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology Std 610.12-1990, 1991
    1. SE is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. 
    2. The study of approaches as in (1)

- Unlike mathematicians, software engineers should ...
    + ... Measure, Simulate, Test, Estimate, Manage projects properly, i.e., effort estimation, planning

> In God we trust, all others must bring data (W. Edwards Deming)

> You can’t control, what you can’t measure (Tom DeMarco)

## Software Analytics

Software analytics is to enable software practitioners to perform data exploration and analysis in order to obtain insightful and actionable information for data driven tasks around software and services
(Zhang et al, Malets’11)

</div>

## Sources of Information

- **Version Control Systems** or Soft Conf Mang (e.g., Git, SVN)
    - Source code, Models, Tests, Requirements, documents...
    - Main public repositories: GitHUB, Bitbucket
- Issue/Bug tracking systems (Bugzilla, Jira, SourceForge)
- Mailing lists (question&answer websites)
- Miscellanea
    - Simulation can also generate tons of data! e.g.System Dynamics to dela with `What if?` questions
    - Google Play and AppStore (e.g., reviews, starts)


## Sources of Information (Tools)

## Software Engieering Life Cycle 



- Requirements: What requirements will provide most user satisfaction while maximising profit, usability, etc?

- Analysis and design: Can we re-organise code/modules/packages so is better distributed for performance/division of labour/allocation of resources, maintenance, etc.

- Coding: All types of metrics can be collected from code to predict defects, allocate testing, code clone detection, etc.
    - Genetic Improvement Or how to plug modules or third party components automatically (e.g., video codecs)

***

- Testing: Most testing techniques can be seen as an optimisation problem, test cases should cover (measured LoC, branches, etc) as much as possible with the minimum no. of test cases
    - There is also reliability estimation, when to stop testing  

- Maintenance and phase out: Regression testing (or how not to break something when we fix another thing)


## Project Management

- What is Project Management? Decisions, decisions, decisions!
    - Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements (PMI).
    - Iron triangle:Time, cost and quality

- Multiple projects/personnel/resources, Project portfolio

- Decision making tasks that need to be optimised!
    - And possible multi-objective
    - Estimation of Cost/Effort/Schedules
    
- And we can help project managers with:
    - Rules, Fuzzy rules, Association Rules
    - Regression
    
- Visualisation, early warning of problems, etc.

## From the DM point of view

- Classification: defect prediction
- Regression: Effort and cost estimation
- Clustering:
- Recommender Systems, e.g.:How to use an API, function calls that tend to be together
- Time series: Evolution of Projects (Clustering/classification of time series)
- Text/Web mining: reviews, bugs reports, requirements from textual descriptions, code comments, documentation
- Social Network Analysis (SNA): mailing lists, GitHub
- Process Mining: logs collected automatically in Web servers, processes followed correctly
- Sequence patterns: Run-time traces
- Graph Mining: Dynamic call graphs

## SE Repositories

Free/Libre Open Source (FLOSS) has provided tons of data to be analysed. Nowdays, the most popular (Big Data!)

<div class="centered">
<img src="./figures/GitHub.png" width=390 height=129>
</div>

For project management, there is the ISBSG  (International SW Benchmarking Standards Group) database but it is not open: http://isbsg.org/

<div class="centered">
<img src="./figures/isbsg.png" width=660 height=109>
</div>

  - Small data (?)  R2016 - approximately 7,000  projects and 60 attributes


## Other popular repositories: PROMISE

PROMISE Repository: http://openscience.us/

## Metrics Grimore

Create an empty database
```bash
$mysql -u root -p -e 'create database weka_cvsanaly;'
```

Run `CVSAnaly2` to populate DB tables
```bash
$cvsanaly2 --db-user=root --db-password=*****  --db- database=weka_cvsanaly
Parsing log for /tmp/weka (svn)
Executing extensions
```

## Metrics Grimore (cont.)

Data are ready to be used!

```bash
$ mysql -u root -p -e 'select * from weka_cvsanaly.actions limit 5;'
Enter password:

And visualised
```bash
vg-github.py --user root --passwd ***** 
      --dir /tmp/temp --removedb --ghuser USER --ghpasswd PW 
      --vgdir /home/drg/git/vizGrimoire  --isuser MetricsGrimoire

# And Vice versa?

## Standards and processes for Data Scientist

- CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)

<div class="centered">
<img src="./figures/marban.png" width=660 height=380>
</div>



## Other Standards


- PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language) is a language used to represent predictive analytic models. It allows for predictive solutions to be easily shared between PMML compliant applications (Source: Wikipedia).

- ASUM-DM Analytics Solutions Unified Method for Data Mining/Predictive Analytics is a refined and extended CRISP-DM (Source: IBM)

# What about papers? {.build}

There is a large number of conferences where will accept these topics of research:
- Mining Software Repositories (MSR)
- Optimisation related: SSBSE (Symposium on SBSE), GECCO (SBSE track)
- And many others: SCAM, ICSE, ICSM, ESEM, PROMISES ...	

Including most important journals:
- Trans on SE, Empirical SE, etc.


## Conclusions

We can wear many hats!
